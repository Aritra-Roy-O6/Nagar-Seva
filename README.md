## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project running locally for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

You must have the following installed on your machine:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
* `npm` or `yarn`
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (with the PostGIS extension enabled)

### Local Setup

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
cd [PROJECT_FOLDER]
```

**2. Setup the Backend Server:**
```bash
# Navigate to the server directory
cd server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create the environment file
cp .env.example .env
```
Now, open the `.env` file and add your PostgreSQL database URL and other secrets.
```env
# server/.env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"
PORT=3001
JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-key"
```
Finally, run the database migrations and start the server:
```bash
# Optional: Add a migration script command to your package.json
# npm run db:migrate 

npm run dev
```
The server should now be running on `http://localhost:3001`.

**3. Setup the Frontend Client:**
```bash
# Navigate to the client directory from the root
cd client

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create the environment file
cp .env.example .env
```
Open the `.env` file to add the backend API URL.
```env
# client/.env
VITE_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3001"
```
Start the React development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The client should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).
